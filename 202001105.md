Q.1. 

Functional Requirements:

There should be a sign in option for the user if he/she wants to borrow a book.

There should be LAN ethernet servers for making the server available only inside the campus.

There should be a notification system which notifies/reminds the user of the deadline to return the book.

If there is overdue in returning the issued book, then the librarian and also the user should be notified.

The application should be made using HTML 5.

The software should use modern encryption algorithms to store confidential information.

If a person wants to register then the password should be of at least 8 characters with conditions like one special character, one big letter, etc.

For the librarian it should manage the records of all the transactions that were done by other users.

Only the librarian should get access to all the records of the users and should be able to do operations such as read, update, delete as per need.


Non Functional Requirements:

Concurrency: It should be able to handle concurrent transactions as there would be several users trying to access the site concurrently.

If the same book is issued by the two different users at the same time then the librarian should be notified.

The load time of the application should be less than 1 second (approximately in milliseconds).

Scalability: The site should handle all the traffic and should not crash for any reason.

The transactions of users should be done within milliseconds.

The site should work only during the library timings so that the librarian knows if there is any issue in the system.

Usability: The UI of the application should be simple enough so that the user can understand.



Q.2.


Scope:

It's a mobile application that helps the people suffering with hearing problems by notifying them of the sounds in their surroundings.

It helps people in making them aware of their surroundings by using AI to detect the sounds, such as when car horns, when dogs bark, etc.

This application has a very simple UI such that a small kid or even an elderly person can understand.


Features:

It's a fast responsive app and has low latency.

It's using AI to detect sounds and help the user to know what’s the sound by notifying the user.

It can also notify you of the sound of a person and you can save that information(sound) as a person’s name.

The accuracy of the AI used in this 99%.


Non Functional Aspects:

It should process the sound in milliseconds because it's critical for a person with hearing aid.

Should also work even if the mobile phone is off because users won't be able to keep the phone on all the time.

Should take up less battery because it would have to run in the background all the time.

Should be able to give sound notification if the user has the mobile in his/her pocket.
